In frame.h:

    struct frame_entry
      {
        struct thread* t;
        void* va_ptr;
        struct page_table_elem* spte;
        bool pinned;
      };

The `frame_entry` struct represents an entry in the frame table. The frame table holds pointers to `frame_entry` structs, which contain the information associated with that entry in the frame table.

- `struct frame_entry** frame_table;`: the frame table itself; an array of `frame_entry`'s.
- `int user_pgs;`: a variable that holds the number of pages designated for user data.
- `void * allocate_page (enum palloc_flags flags);`: a function that replaces `palloc_get_page()` when the kernel needs to allocate a page for a user process. Uses `palloc_get_page()` to allocate a page, then uses that page to create a new entry in the frame table.
- `struct alloc_lock;`: a lock used around page allocation to prevent races.
- `struct frame_lock;`: a lock used around frame table accesses to prevent races.

In page.h:

```  
  struct page_table_elem
    {
      struct hash_elem elem;
      void* addr;             
      int page_no;          
      struct thread* t;       
      struct file* file;      
      char** name;          
      bool writable;         
      size_t page_read_bytes;
      size_t page_zero_bytes;
      int ofs;                
      int pos;                
      bool swapped;           
      struct swap_table_elem* swap_elem;
      struct frame_entry* frame_ptr;
    };
```

A `page_table_elem` is an element of the supplemental page table. It contains all of the necessary information about an entry in the page table and is used to determine what data should be loaded and where it should be put when a page fault occurs due to data not being present. It also contains pointers that associate the SPT entry with corresponding frame table and swap table entries, if they exist.

In the `thread` struct:

- `struct hash s_page_table;`: the supplemental page table.
- `struct lock spt_lock;`: a lock used with the supplemental page table to prevent race conditions when we access and change entries of the table.

In syscall.c:
- `void check_page (void* addr)` in syscall.h. Checks that the address of a buffer we are trying to read data into is not in an unwritable page.

#### ALGORITHMS

> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for accessing the data
> stored in the SPT about a given page.

Each thread has its own supplemental page table, which is a hash table. Each entry in the SPT is associated with a page, and is hashed into the table using its VPN. We made the SPT per-process so that we could hash entries based on their VPNs without running into issues with collisions; multiple distinct processes may have pages with the same VPN since they have distinct virtual address spaces, but each process will only have one page with each VPN. Elements in our SPT are `page_table_elem`s, which contain `hash_elem`s to go in the hash table as well as other necessary data like whether the page is writable, the name of the file that it is associated with, etc.

In most cases, we access data in the SPT by creating a temporary `page_table_elem` with the VPN of the page whose entry we want to find. We then use the `hash_find` function, which returns the `hash_elem` that hashes to the same spot as our temporary element, and use the `hash_entry` macro to convert this into a full `page_table_elem` that contains all of the data stored in that SPT entry.

In some cases, we access SPT entries through our frame table. When we allocate a new frame from an SPT entry, we save a pointer to the SPT entry as a field in the frame table entry for the newly-allocate frame. This allows us to access the SPT entry associated with a frame, even when we don't necessarily know the user virtual address of the page associated with that frame. This is useful when swapping, because when we swap a page out we need to update data in its SPT entry, but we don't have direct access to the user virtual address of that page and thus can't simply hash to get the entry we want.

#### SYNCHRONIZATION

> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
> how are races avoided?

We use a lock, `alloc_lock`, in palloc.c to prevent race conditions. User processes should only try to allocate a page via our `allocate_page()` function, so this lock goes around the code in this function. This ensures that two user processes cannot execute `allocate_page()` concurrently and thus there will be no race conditions surrounding page/frame acquisition.

We do *not* use `alloc_lock` in situations where the kernel is getting a new frame. There will not be any races between user and kernel processes when acquiring frames because they do not share page pools.


#### RATIONALE

> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

Our frame table, which keeps track of which frames are in use, is an array. This is not the most space efficient representation, as it requires a slot in the array even for frames that are not in use. We could potentially make this more efficient by using a multi-level frame table like the page directories that we discussed in class. However, each slot in the array only holds a 4-byte pointer to a `frame_entry` struct, so we do not have to allocate much memory for unused frames. We chose to use an array because it is much more time efficient to find a specific frame entry in an array than it is in a list. We index into the frame table using the PFN of an address, so in order to access the frame table entry corresponding to an address, we just need to convert it to a physical address and extract its frame number. This process only requires some simple bit manipulations and is thus significantly faster than alternatives like iterating through a list to find the entry we want. Also, the time required to access an entry in the frame table stays constant regardless of how many frames are in use, which is not true of a list. The space overhead of our array approach and a list-based approach also become closer as more and more frames come into use.

We used hash tables to implement our supplemental page table. Each thread has a hash table that contains supplemental page table entries that are hashed by VPN. Different threads may try to place pages in the same virtual addresses in their distinct address spaces, so keeping the SPTs separate for each thread prevents collisions and makes it easy to free resources when a thread exits. Like our array approach to the frame table, hash tables are very time efficient and allow us to quickly access entries. The provided hash table implementation also provides functions that make it very easy to insert values into a hash table and to delete a hash table, two important operations with our SPTs. It also takes care of space management and rehashing, which makes our code easier to write, debug, and understand.

### B. PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
#### DATA STRUCTURES

> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct` or
> `struct` member, global or static variable, `typedef`, or
> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In page.h:

- `STACK_SIZE`: a constant that defines the maximum number of pages allowed to be allocated for a single process's stack.
- `void add_stack_page (struct intr_frame *f, void* addr);`: a function that, given an interrupt frame and an address (either an address being checked for use with a system call or an address that caused a page fault), allocates a new page for the current process's stack.
- `void add_spt_page (struct intr_frame *f, void *addr);`: a function that, given an interrupt frame and a user virtual address, allocates a new page based on data in the supplemental page table.
- `bool install_new_page (void *upage, void *kpage, bool writable);`: a function copied from process.c that puts a new page in a process's page directory. Was previously not publicly available, so we copied it to page.c so that it can be used in other files.

In swap.h:

- `struct block* swap_block;`: a pointer to the block device that contains the swap slots.
- `int num_swap_slots;`: the number of swap slots on the `swap_block` devices. Calculated based on the size of `swap_block`, the size of a sector, and the size of a page.
- `struct bitmap* swap_slots;`: a bitmap that represents the free and used swap slots. Each bit is associated with one swap slot, which is the same size as 1 page (8 sectors) and is 0 when the slot is free and 1 when it is being used by some process.
- `struct lock swap_lock;`: a lock used to prevent races around swapping.


- `void swap_init (void);`: a function that finds `swap_block`, calculates `num_swap_slots`, and creates `swap_slots`.
- `void* swap_out (void);`: called when `palloc_get_page()` fails due to a lack of free pages. Finds a frame to evict, saves it to swap space if necessary, and frees the frame so that another process can use it.
- `void swap_in (uint8_t* addr, struct page_table_elem* spte);`: called when a process tries to access a page that has been swapped out. Uses the address that the process tried to access and the SPT entry associated with that address to figure out where the data we want is in swap space and to load it back into memory.


    struct swap_table_elem
      {
        struct list_elem elem;
        int swap_location;
      };

A `swap_table_elem` is an element in the swap table. It contains a `list_elem` so that it can be added to the list of swapped pages owned by a particular thread. It also contains an integer that indicates which index of the swap table bitmap is associated with it.

Whenever we evict a frame, we free its frame table entry (indicating an open space in memory) and we use `pagedir_clear_page()` on the page that was previously in that space. This removes the page from Q's page directory, so now if Q tries to access it, it will page fault. This doesn't necessarily clear the data in the frame, but it does remove restrictions (like read-only permissions) on the page so that P can put a new page in the frame.

> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
> the page that faulted.

We check three things about an invalid address to see if it should cause stack growth. First, we check that the difference between the stack pointer and the invalid address is less than or equal to 32 bytes. If it is, this implies that the instruction that caused the fault was a `push` or `pusha` instruction, so we should extend the stack. The second thing we check is whether the difference is greater than -100000. When we are *not* trying to put data onto the stack, the difference between the stack pointer and the invalid address tends to be a very small negative number, i.e. the difference is millions of bytes. In some cases where we are trying to put a large amount of data onto the stack, the difference will still be a negative number, but it will be much closer to zero. Based on the provided tests, -100000 seems to be a good number that non-stack accesses will be smaller than but stack accesses will be larger than. Finally, we check that the invalid address and the stack pointer are not the same. This only comes into play when we are checking system call addresses, but we don't want to add a page for the stack if the stack pointer itself is invalid; that means that some other problem has occurred.

#### SYNCHRONIZATION ####

> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
> deadlock.)

We use a number of locks for VM synchronization. The following is a list of these locks with the specific situations in which we use them.
- `alloc_lock`: used only in our function `allocate_page()`. This lock ensures that two threads cannot use `allocate_page()` concurrently and prevents races when obtaining a user page for a user process.
- `frame_lock`: used anytime we access or change information in the frame table. This includes creating and removing frame table entries, as well as changing their `pinned` state or associated `spte`. Since the frame table is a global structure that multiple threads may be accessing concurrently, we need to use this lock to prevent race conditions.
- `spt_lock`: each thread has its own supplemental page table and thus has its own `spt_lock` to ensure that other threads cannot access or change anything about a given thread's SPT while it is accessing it itself.
- `swap_lock`: used around the code in `swap_in()` and `swap_out()`. Ensures that a frame cannot be swapped out by one thread concurrently with another thread swapping a frame in, or vice versa.
- `file_lock`: a lock originally created in project 2. Ensures that two processes cannot access the file system at the same time.

We try to prevent deadlock by acquiring locks in a specific order when we need to hold more than one at a time. This order is as follows. The locks are never all held by one thread at the same time, but if we, for example, need `alloc_lock` and `frame_lock` at the same time, we will acquire `alloc_lock` first and `frame_lock` second, and release `frame_lock` first and `alloc_lock` second.
1. `alloc_lock`
2. `swap_lock`
3. `file_lock`
4. `frame_lock`
5. `spt_lock` for the current thread

Although enforcing an ordering like this can be tricky in larger and more complicated code bases, it is the simplest way to avoid deadlock. Since we use these locks in a relatively small part of the overall Pintos codebase and they are only used in a couple of functions written for this project, we believe that our approach will prevent deadlock.

After selecting a frame to evict but before starting the actual swapping-out process, we remove the selected frame from the owning process's page directory using `pagedir_clear_page()`. This unmaps the frame's section of memory in the process's address space, so if the process tries to read or write to it, it will page fault. There is a lock, `swap_lock()` around the code in our swapping functions `swap_in()` and `swap_out()`, that ensures that a frame cannot be swapped out while any other frame is being swapped back in (or vice versa).

> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q

Our `swap_lock` mentioned in the previous questions handles this as well. Since it prevents the code in `swap_in()` and `swap_out()` from being run concurrently, it ensures that a frame that is being read in by process P cannot be evicted by process Q until P finishes. We also use `swap_lock()` around the code in `add_spt_page()` that reads from the file system to ensure that a page from a file being read in due to a page fault cannot be evicted while it is being read in.

We decided to use several locks (5, if you count each thread's individual `spt_lock` as one) rather than just one to allow for higher parallelism. Although this is more complicated than just using one lock, it allows our code to run multiple threads more efficiently. The number of locks we used was low enough that it was not too difficult to maintain a total ordering for lock acquisition and thus avoid deadlock bugs.
