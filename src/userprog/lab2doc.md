#### ALGORITHMS

> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do

> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

We do all of the argument parsing and passing in the `setup_stack()` function. We initially tried implementing it in `process_start()`, but had trouble getting it to work there. Placing this code in `setup_stack()` makes sense because putting the arguments to a process on the stack is indeed part of setting up the stack for the new process. However, it does require us to also parse the name of the file to load and run earlier on, which is likely not the most efficient way to do it.

In `setup_stack()`, if allocation of the new thread's page is successful, we parse the arguments from the command line using `strtok_r()` and place them in an array of character arrays called `args`. There is an arbitrary limit of 32 arguments per process. Then, we push information onto the stack as specified in the project description, starting at the top of the stack (higher addresses) and going down.

First, we write each string in the in `args` to the stack. Each time we write one string, we save its address on the stack in another array, `argv`. We then write some zeroes to the stack to align following data on the word boundary, and write the contents of `argv` to the stack. Both times we write an array to the stack, we start writing with its last element and end with its first. This ensures that the pointers to the arguments are in the right order. At the end of writing the contents of `argv`, we also save the address of the first argument (the last one we wrote) and write that address to the bottom of the stack as well. This ensures that the program can find the pointers to the actual arguments. At the end, we write `argc` (the number of actual arguments) and a null pointer to the end of the stack.

**how do we avoid overflowing the stack page?**

#### RATIONALE/JUSTIFICATION

> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

According to the `strtok()` man page, `strtok_r()` is thread-safe but `strtok()` is not. We may have multiple threads trying to tokenize strings at the same time, so we need to use a version that is thread-safe.

At least for us, it was difficult to find a location in the kernel code where we could (at last somewhat) efficiently implement argument parsing in a way that actually worked. If we were able to parse the arguments in the shell, this would not be an issue, because the arguments could be separated and saved into an array immediately after they are entered by the user. Thus, it would be an advantage on the designer's end simply because it would be easier to implement. Also, parsing arguments in the shell might allow users to have more control over how they want their arguments to be interpreted - perhaps they could set specific settings with the shell that allow them to use shortcuts or type different things but get the same result. This would not be possible if the kernel parsed the arguments because those settings would have to be programmed beforehand.

### SYSTEM CALLS

#### DATA STRUCTURES

> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct` or
> `struct` member, `global` or `static` variable, `typedef`, or
> enumeration.  Document the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

New fields in `thread` struct:

- `struct semaphore process_sema;`: a semaphore used by `process_wait()` to block a parent thread until its child is finished executing.
- `struct thread_elem* element;`: the node associated with this thread in the `thread_list` list.
- `struct semaphore exec_sema;`: a semaphore used to synchronize thread creation with `process_execute()`.
- `struct list locks;`: a list of locks currently held by this thread.

New fields in `lock` struct:
- `struct list_elem elem;`: a list element that allows this lock to be added to a thread's `locks` list.

Functions:
- `struct thread* get_thread_all (tid_t tid)` in thread.c. Given a thread ID, searches the list of all threads and returns a pointer to the thread associated with that TID, if it exists.
- `void sys_exit(struct intr_frame *f)` in syscall.c. Implements the `exit` system call.
- `void sys_write(struct intr_frame *f)` in syscall.c. Implements the `write` system call.
- `static tid_t sys_exec(struct intr_frame *f)` in syscall.c. Implements the `exec` system call.
- `static void sys_halt()` in syscall.c. Implements the `halt` system call.
- `static bool sys_create(struct intr_frame *f)` in syscall.c. Implements the `create` system call.
- `int sys_wait (struct intr_frame *f)` in syscall.c. Implements the `wait` system call.
- `void check_address (void* addr, struct intr_frame *f)` in syscall.c. Checks a given address to ensure that the current thread has legal access to it, and kills the thread otherwise.
- `int write (int fd, const void *buffer, unsigned length)` in syscall.c.

New declarations in thread.h:

- `struct list thread_list;`: a list where each node is associated with a thread that is either currently alive (blocked, running, or ready) or a thread that has recently died. Each `list_elem` in this list is part of a `thread_elem` struct. We remove elements from the list once the associated thread has been waited on once by its parent.

```
struct thread_elem
  {
    struct list_elem elem;
    tid_t* tid;
    int exit_status;
    struct thread* parent;
  };
```
The `thread_elem` struct contains the information associated with each node in the `thread_list` list. The `list_elem` field is inserted into `thread_list`. Each thread points to the `thread_elem` in the list that contains its information, although some `thread_elem`s are associated with dead threads that have been deallocated.

- `struct lock file_lock;`: A lock used to prevent race conditions when we access the file system.

Our `wait` system call retrieves the process ID to wait on, then calls the `process_wait()` function on that process ID. `process_wait()` first verifies that the child thread to wait on is alive. If it isn't, then the parent process should not wait, so we check `thread_list` to see if the child's `thread_elem` is present in the list. If it isn't, we return -1, because the parent process has already waited on the child or the child never existed in the first place. If it is present, we retrieve and return its `exit_status` and then remove its `thread_elem` from `thread_list` to prevent the parent from waiting on it later.

If the thread associated with the `child_tid` argument is alive, then the parent process calls `sema_down()` on the child's `process_sema` field. The child calls `sema_up()` on this semaphore immediately before it exits, regardless of whether it exited normally or was killed. This unblocks the parent thread immediately, even if the child is deallocated before the parent thread resumes execution. When the parent starts again, it retrieves the child's `exit_status` from its `thread_elem` (which was not a field of the child's `thread` struct and thus was not deallocated with the child), removes the child's `thread_elem` from `thread_list`, frees the child's `thread_elem`'s `malloc`'ed memory, and then returns its exit status. We set the child's exit status to -1 elsewhere if it is killed, so `process_wait()` does not need to check for any extra cases.

We check all addresses passed into system calls, including the address of the argument passed to the system call handler, in a function called `check_address()`. This function forces a thread to exit if the address passed in is null, if it is a kernel virtual address (i.e. a user program should not be allowed to access it), or if it points to unmapped user virtual memory. We have to check addresses frequently, since we have to do it on every address passed in to a system call, but this checking does not obscure the primary function of code as each check only requires a call to `check_address()`.

If a function does try to pass a bad pointer to a system call, we call `thread_exit()` to kill the thread. This function naturally leads to thread deallocation as part of the thread scheduling process. Beforehand, we call a function called `release_locks()` that iterates through the locks held by the current thread (kept track of in its `locks` list field) and releases each one. This ensures that any thread exiting abnormally does not hold onto any locks, so other threads won't get stuck waiting on a thread that has been killed.

**definitely need more here, especially after file system calls are written**

#### SYNCHRONIZATION

> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Our `exec` system call calls `process_execute()` in process.c and simply returns the value returned by that function, so all of the synchronization work happens in `process_execute()`. The `process_execute()` function does a bit of work, then calls `thread_create()` to start a new thread in the function `start_process()`. `start_process()` calls `load()` to load the executable for the child process to run in `start_process()`. The parent process needs to wait until the child has attempted to load the executable (successfully or not) before it can continue, because the parent process needs to know whether the load failed before it can return.

We enforce this using a semaphore called `exec_sema` that is part of the parent thread's `thread` struct. Immediately after calling and returning from `thread_create()` (i.e., as soon as possible), we call `sema_down()` on the parent's `exec_sema` to force it to wait. The child process then calls `sema_up()` on this same semaphore once its call to `load()` has finished. If the call wasn't successful, we set the child process's exit code to -1, then call `sema_up()`; otherwise, we just call `sema_up()` as soon as the load is done. Calling `sema_up()` after the child has attempted to load blocks the parent until we know the outcome of `load()`.

Once the parent starts executing again, it checks the child's exit status; if it's -1, we know that the load failed, so we return -1 from `process_execute()`. Otherwise (unless some other unrelated issue has occurred), we return the thread ID of the new child thread.
